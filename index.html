		  	<li>The HTML layout is very refined and the code is very neat which lacks in my web page</li>

		  	<li>CSS has been used to structure and add beauty to the web page which is still not in my territory</li>

		  	<li>HTML5 does not support image tag to be aligned to the center natively and requires CSS which makes the images look really out of place</li>
